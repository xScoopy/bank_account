# bank_account

BankAccount.py for CS1.1

For this assignment, I was tasked with creating a terminal bank account. 
Using the 'BankAccount' class, I instantiated 3 objects of scoop_account, joi_account, and jess_account. 
I then called all of the class methods on each of those objects to show they were in fact working. 

Each definition has a docstring mentioning its purpose.

Program is written using Python 3, and made use of Random by importing randint.
